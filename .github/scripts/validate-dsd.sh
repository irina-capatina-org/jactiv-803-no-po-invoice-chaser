# Checks that the as-built DSD(s) EXIST and are viable markdown - nothing more.
#
# Usage: .github/scripts/validate-dsd.sh <architecture.json>
#
# This used to enforce a nine-section contract, per-section table minimums, code-path
# existence, document-control fields and rule traceability. All of it is gone on
# purpose. Nothing downstream reads the DSD: it is generated after the build was built,
# tested and reviewed, so it can never be the thing that blocks a delivery, and every
# rule it enforced was a rule an agent had to spend generation time satisfying. One
# run lost 238 seconds - over half the stage - to two checks that were themselves
# wrong.
#
# What is left is the question actually worth asking: is there a file, and can I open
# it in front of someone without it looking broken? So: it exists, it is not a stub,
# it has a title and some sections, no code fence is left hanging (which would swallow
# the rest of the page when rendered) and no table is a header with no rows.
#
# The DSD path comes from the REPOSITORY name, derived exactly as uipath-dsd.yml
# derives it, so the validator and the workflow cannot disagree about which file
# should exist.
